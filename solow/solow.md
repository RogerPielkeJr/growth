# The Solow Model
We're now going to get into the theory of how growth works. We want to explain *why* economies appear to follow a [balanced growth path](http://growthecon.com/StudyGuide/facts/bgp.html) (BGP) eventually, what determines the growth rate along those BGP's, and why some BGP's involve GDP per capita at a higher level than others.
