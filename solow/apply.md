## Finding the BGP in the United States
We can apply the Solow model to specific cases, and use it to tell the story behind the economic growth that occurred. To start, consider the US, which is relatively boring. The figure below plots the log GDP per capita in the US over time, as we've seen before. What I've added to the figure are two hypothetical BGP lines. The two BGP lines differ in how they were constructed. 

The "BGP All" (in orange) was fitted to the entire span of data, 1950-2017. While actual GDP per capita is not exactly on this orange BGP at all times, throughout the 20th century it stays quite close to the BGP. The experience after 2008 shows a distinct drop relative to the BGP, given the financial crisis. Since then GDP per capita does not look to have recovered back to the BGP. Hold onto that thought.

The "BGP 20th" (in green) was fitted only using the 20th century, 1950-2000. The data in the 20th century stays closer to this line than before. But this would indicate an even larger drop relative to the BGP starting in 2008. If you look closer, you'll see that GDP per capita appears to fall behind the BGP even starting around 2000. 

This gives us some interesting questions. The first is whether the recent drop of GDP per capita below the old BGP reflects a permanent change in the level of GDP per capita, or whether this is a temporary deviation like in the late 1950s-early 1960s. This question has huge implications for the future level of GDP per capita, and so there is a separate section on it later in the coruse. 

The second question about this figure, which we'll focus on for the remainder of this sub-section, is what it means that we found a BGP that "fit" for the US. Recall from the [theory](level.html#countries-with-different-bgps) that we can adjust $s_I$, $g_L$, $A_0$ and other parameters to move a BGP up and down. Those BGP lines in the above figure are essentially moving those parameters up and down until the line fits the evidence on GDP per capita.
