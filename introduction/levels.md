## Basic concepts
The first thing we need to do is distinguish between the *level* of something (like GDP), the *growth* of that thing, and the *growth rate* of that thing. 

Here's a table showing some made-up data on GDP for several different years. The level is the actual amount of GDP produced in that year. The *growth* of GDP is just the absolute change in GDP from one year to the next. There is no growth recorded in 2018 because we don't have the data for 2017, and so we cannot calculate the absolute change. 

| Year | Level | Growth | Growth rate |
|:-----|:------------------|:------|:----|
| 2018 | 100 |    |       |
| 2019 | 104 | 4  | 4.00% |
| 2020 |  98 | -6 | -5.77% |
| 2021 | 103 | 5  | 5.10% |
| 2022 | 105 | 2  | 1.94% |
| 2023 | 107 | 2  | 1.90% |
| 2024 | 109 | 2  | 1.87% |

The growth rate of GDP in this table is the *percent change* in GDP from one year to the next. So from 2018 to 2019, the growth rate was $(104 - 100)/100 = .04$, or 4%. The next year, the absolute change in GDP was negative, so the growth rate was $(98-104)/104 = -.0577$, or -5.77%. And so on. Remember that when calculating the growth rate, you have to use the earlier year in the denominator of the calculation.

{: .label } 
A percent is just 100 times a decimal. Saying "7%" is the same thing as saying "0.07". In the study guide we'll flip back and forth between these two.

There are a few interesting things to notice about how levels, growth, and growth rates work together. Take a look at the years 2022, 2023, and 2024. In each of these years, the absolute growth of GDP is 2, meaning that GDP goes up by exactly the same amount each year. But when we calculate the *growth rate* of GDP in those years, the growth rate declines from 1.94% to 1.90% to 1.87%. Why? Because the level of GDP is increasing, and so the absolute growth (2) represents a smaller percent change in GDP than before. 

This highlights that you have to be very careful when talking about GDP and the growth rate of GDP. It is quite possible for the growth rate to be declining (as it did from 2022-2024) and yet GDP is rising by just as much as it was in the past. A fall in the growth rate does *not* mean that the level of GDP fell. 

## Average or annualized growth rates
In the table above, we calculated an *annual* growth rate, meaning it was the percent change in GDP from one year to the next. But we don't have to limit ourselves to this. What if we don't want to look at all the individual growth rates, but instead want some kind of growth rate that indicates how much GDP grew on average from 2018 to 2024?

From 2018 to 2024, *aggregate* growth in GDP was 9 (109 minus 100). And the aggregate growth rate was $(109-100)/100 = .09$ or 9%. GDP grew by a total of 9% from 2018 to 2024. 

That's true, but it perhaps isn't the most useful number. What we really want is something that gives us an idea of how much GDP grew on average each year from 2018 to 2024. To get that, we want to calculate an *annualized* growth rate. When we calculate an annualized growth rate, we look for a growth rate, call it $g_Y$, such that

## Mathematical formulas
Let's be a little more formal about all of this
