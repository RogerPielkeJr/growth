## Visual comparison
You can get all the important intuition for how we measure GDP by thinking just about two goods, and looking at two time periods.

In our little two-good world, the real amount of $c_1$ and $c_2$ produced and consumed is a result of an interaction of our preferences for the two goods and the production possibilities frontier that tells us the physical trade-off in producing good 1 in terms of good 2. But we cannot observe the utility function or the PPF, we only observe the actual market outcomes. That is, we see the nominal price that each sells for $p_1$ and $p_2$, and we know the quantity produced, $c_1$ and $c_2$.

Moreover, we observe these market outcomes both in the present, and in the past. And we'd like to compare the bundle of goods produced in those two periods and figure out whether we are better or worse off - whether economic growth occurred. If $c_{2,Present} > c_{2,Past}$ and $c_{1,Present}>c_{1,Past}$, then it is straightforward to conclude that the present is better off than the past (assuming both goods are normal goods).

The above figure gives a simple demonstration of this. The lines included have a slope $-p_1/p_2$, which gives the relative price of the two goods in either the past or present. As drawn, that relative price is different in past and present, but note that this doesn't change the conclusion that the present is better off than in the past in this case. A second thing to note is that pure inflation in prices is not an issue in the figure. We have the real quantities graphed, and the slope of the line is unaffected by the absolute price level, because it captures the relative price of the two goods. What we cannot do just by looking at the figure, however, is put a firm number on the increase in real consumption. 

The bigger issue comes when we have a situation as in the figure below, where the present consumes more of good 2, but less of good 1. Now, it is not obvious whether the economy is better off or not. If we valued everything at the relative prices of the past, then the present is obviously better (i.e. it would appear that the constraint shifted up). But if we valued everything at the relative prices of the present, then it would look like the *past* is obviously better (i.e. it would again appear that the constraint shifted up). Notice that this is not an issue with pure inflation in prices, as again all that we're focusing on here is the relative price of goods within a given period.

![Ambiguous change](fig-real-gdp-ambig.eps)

How do we compare past and present, then, and figure out whether the real value of the consumption bundle has increased or decreased? The answer is that we're going to compare them from both perspectives (e.g. compare them using the relative prices of the past, and then compare then using the relative prices of the present) and do something like average those perspectives.
