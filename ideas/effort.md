## Accounting for growth
We know that productivity growth, $g_A$, determines the growth rate on the BGP. But we can establish further that productivity growth is responsible for *most* of the growth in GDP per capita over time. This will just reinforce the importance of understanding the economics of productivity growth.

To do this we're going to build some hypothetical paths for log GDP per capita. Start with our description of log GDP per capita that *includes* human capital. 

$$
\ln y_t = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} (\ln K_t/Y_t) + \ln h_t + \ln A_t.
$$

Next, we're going to set a base year to start with. In this case, we'll use 1960. For that year, we'll record the capital/output ratio, $K_{1960}/Y_{1960}$, the human capital level, $h_{1960}$, and the level of productivity, $A_{1960}$. 

With that information, let's build a series of hypothetical GDP per capita that depends *only* on what happened to the capital/output ratio from 1960 to 2017. This will be

$$
\ln y_t^{KY} = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} (\ln K_t/Y_t) + \ln h_{1960} + \ln A_{1960}
$$

and tells us what log GDP per capita would have been in a hypothetical world where the *only* thing that changed over time was the capital/output ratio, but where human capital and productivity stayed at exactly their 1960 levels the entire time. If $\ln y_t^{KY}$ were to turn out to be very close to the actual GDP per capita, $\ln y_t$, then we'd know that capital/output was mainly responsible for actual growth in GDP per capita, and that human capital and productivity were unimportant. 

We can do something similar for both human capital and productivity. 

$$
\ln y_t^{HC} = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} (\ln K_{1960}/Y_{1960}) + \ln h_{t} + \ln A_{1960}
$$

and 

$$
\ln y_t^{Prod} = \frac{\alpha}{1-\alpha} (\ln K_{1960}/Y_{1960}) + \ln h_{1960} + \ln A_{t}.
$$

If you plot these all these series together for the US, along with the path of actual log GDP per capita, you get the following figure.

What does this show us? Perhaps the most striking feature is that, by itself, the capital/output ratio would have *lowered* GDP per capita from 1960 to 2017. In the US the share of GDP allocated to capital goods fell slightly over time, and hence the K/Y ratio declined. This pulled down on GDP per capita. Note that we shouldn't have expected this to have a huge effect on GDP per capita in the first place. The US appeared to be on a BGP, and the K/Y ratio should have been stable anyway. 

Human capital, the yellow line, by itself would have led to a mild increase in GDP per capita. From 1960 to 1980 there was growth in human capital per person, mainly due to the increase in the ratio of workers to people because of the Baby Boom and the spread of college education. From 1980 to 2017 the level of human capital per person would have allowed for slight growth in GDP per capita, all by itself. 

Finally, the green line plots GDP per capita due only to the change in productivity. This appeared to be responsible for the vast majority of growth. The gap between the green line (productivity only) and the red line (actual GDP per capita) is the GDP per capita accounted for by growth in capital/output and human capital. Productivity cannot explain *all* of the increase in GDP per capita experienced from 1960 to 2017, but it can explain *most* of it. 

## Increasing research effort
Productivity and productivity growth is therefore of incredible importance to the study of economic growth. Where does higher productivity come from?
