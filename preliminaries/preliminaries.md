# Preliminaries

This topic deals with some mathematical tools necessary to study growth. This material is really meant as a reference. If you have a good grasp of algebra and basic calculus, and are comfortable with how logs and exponentials work, then you should feel free to skip to the rest of the content of the course.

For Fall 2020 the pre-reqs of my course do not include calc, because our major does not require calc. However, it is almost impossible to study economic growth without some simple calc tools. There is a section in this material about these simple calc tools, which you can see as simple a set of recipes to apply in certain situations. We will require calculus starting in 2020 for new majors, as per a new state rule.
