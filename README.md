Materials for a course in economic growth based on Jones and Vollrath's "Introduction to Economic Growth". Available at [Amazon](https://amzn.to/2Ytb3pB).

## Structure
The concept of the study guide is to provide the material in layers. The top layer contains the major topics listed in the table of contents in the sidebar, and these are presented at a basic level that assumes familiarity with intermediate economics and algebra. The second layer, which can be found as sub-sections of those major topics, dives deeper into the math and analysis using calculus and regressions. The final layer, which are sub-sub-sections of the major topics, goes into even finer detail and often includes references to published academic papers.
