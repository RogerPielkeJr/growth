## Productivity drives growth
One of the big ideas we'll cover is that productivity - better technology, better organization, better blueprints - is what drives economic growth in the long run. Growth occurs because we find ways to get more value out of fewer inputs like time, capital, and natural resources. 

A real visceral way to see this is to consider how much time it would take you to produce something simple, like a sandwich, all by yourself. Like the video shows, it might take you around 6 months and 1500 dollars to do this.

In reality, if you want a sandwich it could take as little as five minutes and 6 dollars. Going from the 1500/6-month sandwich to the 6/5-minute sandwich represents getting more sandwich for less effort. And that is all economic growth is. Getting more value from fewer inputs.
