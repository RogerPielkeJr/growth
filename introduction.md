# Big questions in economic growth

The first part of the course is about building up an understanding of the facts of economic growth, and the main models for understanding those facts. That framework will then be used to think about a series of more specific questions related to growth and how it interacts with other areas of the economy, society, and governance.

## Are we rich?

## Are there regularities to economic growth?

## Why is growth so stable?

## What drives growth in the long-run?
One of the big ideas we'll cover is that productivity - better technology, better organization, better blueprints - is what drives economic growth in the long run. Growth occurs because we find ways to get more value out of fewer inputs like time, capital, and natural resources. 

A real visceral way to see this is to consider how much time it would take you to produce something simple, like a sandwich, all by yourself. Like the video shows, it might take you around 6 months and 1500 dollars to do this.

In reality, if you want a sandwich it could take as little as five minutes and 6 dollars. Going from the 1500 dollar/6-month sandwich to the 6 dollar/5-minute sandwich represents getting more sandwich for less effort. And that is all economic growth is. Getting more value from fewer inputs.

## Why does anyone bother to innovate?

## What applications does all this have?

1. Why does China grow so fast, and will it continue?
2. Are robots going to steal all the jobs?
3. Why did sustained growth come from in the first place?
4. What effect does growth have on the environment?
5. How does trade affect growth, and vice versa?
6. Is economic growth going to disappear?
7. Can we speed up growth with certain policies?
8. What explains why some countries are so rich compared to others?
9. How does the organization of industries affect growth?
